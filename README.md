# maze-blast-game
A simple dungeon maze game in C#. A Windows Forms app using GDI+. This is a work in progress- improvements on the way!

## Introduction
This little game started as a final assignment to my second-year OOP course, but it has bloomed into an ongoing project.

## Technologies
* Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16.7.3
* Microsoft .NET Framework Version 4.8.04.084

## Setup
Coming Soon

## Gameplay
The player must traverse the maze and reach the door without being stopped by the monsters.

Watch out! The monsters have two ways to win - they can catch the player, or make it to the door first.
The monsters can also teleport!

When the player moves in one direction, the monsters move in the opposite direction - so watch the whole maze, or you'll walk a monster straight to the door!



## Planned Changes / Bug Fixes
* Fix maze sizing issue
* Improved monster movement and distribution - fix overlapping monster issue 
* Higher-quality sprites
* Randomized mazes
* New kinds of monsters with different motion patterns
* Animation / sounds for win / lose scenarios
